        " transformation and self-realization.  It is about self-examination by connecting with the powerful " +

        "<br>" +
        "It is a personal transformation work for releasing the unconsciousness human " +
        "conditioning of the heart due to suffering within our current lifetime, parents, ancestors," +
        " society/cultural, collective influences, etc. The intent of this work is to release the conditioning " +
        "of the heart and connect to the full spectrum of all of energies of the heart – love, compassion, " +
        "gratitude, peace, harmony, joy, oneness, and many more.   The average person typically carries so " +
        "much suffering that they are accessing only 0-1% of available heart energies.  Children between age " +
        "between 0-4 typically access 80-100%.  Highly self-realized people which are very rare in current " +
        "times or in our history such as Ramana Marshashi, Papiji, Adyashanti, etc are accessing 90-100% of " +
        "available heart energies.  Even some of the best selling authors and well-known contemporary spiritual " +
        "teachers are only accessing 10-25% of their available heart energies.  The goal of this work is help " +
        "people access 80-100% of their heart energies and return ourselves to natural states like children. " +
        "<br>" +
        "<h6>IS THIS FOR PUBLIC AUDIENCE OR FOR HEALING PROFESSIONALS?</h6>" +
        " This is programme for both PUBLIC audience and for HEALING PRACTITIONERS (beginners to advanced). " +
        "For the PUBLIC, this is for everyone – mother, father, engineer, doctor, teacher, artist, psychologist, " +
        "lawyer, etc.  This programme is designed to be highly transformative to release the conditioning that blocks " +
        "our hearts, and as we do that many people (not all) are reporting to have found deeper peace, love," +
        " gratitude within themselves and more harmony with family and interacting with their loved ones.  " +
        "Understand as you work through your own deep conditioning of the heart, all those hurt feelings from " +
        "your lifetime, parents, ancestors, society & collective influences, you in-DIRECTLY transform all those " +
        "around you because your personal healing affects all those connected to you on the DNA level – " +
        "your mother, father, son, daughter, relatives, they receive a healing when you transform.  " +
        "When you heal yourself, everyone around you heals…. For the HEALERS, beginner or advanced, it is by far " +
        "the most powerful and enlightening program yet.  It is no longer about learning another technique.  " +
        "This program is about doing deep personal transformation work and in the process of it developing your " +
        "ability to access the SUPERCONSCIOUS awareness.  This state is typically accessed by those who have " +
        "became fully self-realized (enlightened) which is very difficult to do such as Ramana Marhashi, " +
        "Papiji, Adyashanti, etc.  As we move closer and closer to full self-realization, we take steps toward " +
        "accessing more and more of the SUPERCONSCIOUS.  In this space, it is NOT the techniques or methods that are " +
        "doing the work, it is divine energy transmissions activated through the heart.  In fact, most healers " +
        "whether beginners or advanced still carry lots of heart conditioning.  I PERSONALLY HAD A VERY CLOSED HEART," +
        " and was an advanced practitioner with a successful practice.  Now, after working through my own deep heart " +
        "conditioning (unconscious and hurt feelings), my work with clients has been even more PROFOUND. " +
        "Ease and flow with business, finances, and abundance."
